<p>Nothing sounds quite as relaxing as kicking back and relaxing in a hammock – and there’s no better way to celebrate Hammock Day! </p>
<p>Get swinging and swaying in the backyard, or somewhere far beyond in the remote outdoors, with something as simple as a piece of fabric tied to a few strings! </p>

<h2>History of Hammock Day </h2>
</div>
<p>Situated just in the middle of the summer, Hammock Day celebrates everything related to relaxation, summer breezes and just ‘hanging’ out! </p>
<p>The invention of hammocks can be traced back to the Central and South Americas at least 1000 years ago. They seem to have been introduced to Christopher Columbus by the Taino people of the Bahamas on his voyages to the New World, and he then brought the concept back for Europeans to enjoy. </p>
<p>Hammocks were not originally created for relaxation and enjoyment as much as for protection from the elements and wild animals on the ground. Later in the 1600s, it was discovered that hammocks worked well for sleeping on ships, as it tended to reduce the amount of seasickness suffered by the sailors. </p>
<p>Now, hammocks have become a favorite part of leisure time, especially when used as a convenient and comfortable place for sleeping while hiking and camping. </p>

</div>
<h2 id="h-how-to-celebrate-hammock-day" class="heading">How to Celebrate Hammock Day </h2>
<p>Celebrating Hammock Day can obviously be pretty simple–just hang a hammock and climb in! But there might be some other more interesting ways to dig deeper and enjoy the day further. Try these creative thoughts or come up with some other ideas that will give Hammock Day the place it deserves: </p>
<h3 id="h-hang-up-a-hammock" class="heading"><strong>Hang Up a Hammock </strong></h3>
<p>Sure, it’s obvious, but it’s still the right place to start. Find two sturdy, conveniently located trees (or improvise – and it certainly doesn’t have to be limited to the outdoors), string up a comfy bed… and relax! The best spot might be near a big tree that provides shade, but the options are almost endless, really. </p>
<p>For those who don’t have any conveniently located trees, consider buying a hammock stand to keep in the backyard and hang a hammock on. They’re sturdy and don’t require the tying and re-tying each time like when hanging a hammock from a tree. </p>
<h3 id="h-buy-a-hammock" class="heading"><a href="https://www.flyingsquirreloutfitters.com/collections" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Buy a Hammock </strong></a></h3>
<p>For those who don’t have one, Hammock Day is the perfect time to make an investment in the adventure of a hammock! Running from the very inexpensive to luxury models, hammocks offer long-lasting enjoyment. Some companies that sell hammocks even offer discounts (<a href="https://www.flyingsquirreloutfitters.com/collections/basecamp-1-basecamp-hammock">such as buy one-get one for 40% off)</a> in honor and celebration of Hammock Day. </p>
<h3 id="h-enjoy-various-activities-in-a-hammock" class="heading"><strong>Enjoy Various Activities in a Hammock </strong></h3>
<p>Just having and hanging a hammock isn’t enough–it’s necessary to relax and enjoy the time spent in it! Try these ideas for things to do in that comfortable swinging bed: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Take a Nap.</strong><span> </span>Of course one of the things most people envision first when thinking of hammocks is using them to take a nap! It’s a delightful way to enjoy a little snooze and get some rest with the sounds and smells of nature all around. </li>
<li>
<strong>Read a Book.<span> </span></strong>One great way to relax in a hammock is by reading a favorite book or magazine. Although it’s certainly possible to use this as a time to read books for school or work, a better way to use hammock time is to read books that are simply delightful and relaxing, whose only purpose is simply to be enjoyed. </li>
<li>
<strong>Enjoy the Breeze.</strong><span> </span>If the hammock is positioned right, a little summer breeze might just come in the direction and keep things cool. </li>
<li>
<strong>Swing.</strong><span> </span>A hammock is all about the soothing state of swinging! Moving gently back and forth while wrapped up in a cocoon-like fabric can provide a comforting sensation that is hard to compete with! </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h-attend-a-hammock-day-event" class="heading"><strong>Attend a Hammock Day Event </strong></h3>
<p>Around the world, especially in the subculture of camping, hiking and outdoor living, Hammock Day is becoming more and more popular. People can participate by themselves on their own or gather together in a group of friends to pay homage to the lovely vibes that spending time in a hammock brings. </p>
<p>For instance, in 2018, more than 3600 campers committed to sleeping under the stars in hammocks for Hammock Day. Kammock (a company that sells hammocks and other outdoor gear) hosted an event in Austin, Texas that included live music, snacks (such as popsicles and kombucha), and obviously getting out into nature to enjoy swinging, hanging and sleeping in hammocks. </p>
<p>Those who don’t live near an existing event shouldn’t let that stop them! Maybe it’s time to consider starting a new Hammock Day event. It certainly doesn’t have to be sponsored by a company. Some different organizations and groups that have been inspired to organize Hammock Day events include local libraries, outdoor climbing or hiking groups, campgrounds and more. </p>
<h3 id="h-listen-to-hammock-inspired-music" class="heading"><strong>Listen to Hammock Inspired Music</strong></h3>
<p>Fire up a playlist of songs that are inspired by hammock-related things such as relaxation, island themes and enjoying the outdoors. Start with these songs and come up with a list of others to add: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Hammock Song</strong><span> </span>(2014) by David Cline. This fun song has all of the fun road-trip and hammock sleeping vibes a person could want! </li>
<li>
<strong>The Island Song<span> </span></strong>(2017) by Seven Less Shadows. Sure, the hammock only gets one mention, but the whole song is about friendship and ocean breezes. </li>
<li>
<strong>Swingin’ on a Hammock</strong><span> </span>(1930) Kate Smith. A classic ode to the joy and beauty of sharing a hammock with a loved one. </li>
<li>
<strong>Hammock<span> </span></strong>(2014) by Tyler Sjöström. A bluegrass vibe comes from this lighthearted song dedicated to spending time in a “hammock all day”. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h-learn-about-the-health-benefits-of-hammocks" class="heading"><strong>Learn About the Health Benefits of Hammocks </strong></h3>
<p>Many people don’t know that sleeping in a hammock can actually be good for the health! Some studies have shown that people who sleep in hammocks tend to fall asleep faster and get more restorative sleep than those who sleep in normal beds. </p>
<p>Certain health experts even agree that sleeping in a hammock can possibly take pressure off of the spine and reduce the incidence and severity of back pain. (Of course, the hammock must offer strong support, and it’s a good idea to check with a doctor to be sure!)</p>]]>

<p> </p>
<p><span>You’ve been dreaming of warmer weather, and now it’s finally here. Whether you’re trying to entertain picky kids, wrangle the family together for some outdoor bonding, or looking to DIY a new backyard project, you’ve come to the right place. Let the good times roll with these fun outdoor activities. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<div class="hentry-content-captionless-image-wrapper"><img class="wp-image-50634 aligncenter" src="https://porch.com/advice/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/katherine-hanlon-xaG8oaZD7ss-unsplash-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="453"></div>
<h3><strong>Outdoor activities for kids</strong></h3>
<p><span>Between video games, Tik Tok challenges, and a smorgasbord of binge-able TV shows, getting your kids outside can be a real struggle. Fear not – we’ve got ideas a-plenty for keeping your offspring outdoors and entertained.</span></p>
<p><b>Go on a scavenger hunt</b></p>
<p><span>Scavenger hunts build </span><a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.psych.031809.130730" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.psych.031809.130730', 'problem-solving skills');" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>problem-solving skills</span></a><span>, teach teamwork, and they’re easy to customize to your child’s age. Start by writing down clues, or use one of many free online scavenger hunt templates to get ideas if you’re stuck. Hide the clues and little treasures around the backyard. If you don’t have tiny treasures lying around the house, head to the dollar store for fun trinkets your child will have a blast hunting for.</span></p>
<p><b>Get wet with water games</b></p>
<p><span>Water games are a saving grace in the dog days of summer when it’s too hot for other outdoor activities. You can choose simple games — turn on the sprinkler and let your kids go ham, or load up on water balloons for an epic battle. For more challenging games, lay down a plastic sheet or tarp, and lay it under your sprinkler — the kids will love slipping and sliding and splashing around. Water limbo is another family favorite — have one person hold the hose while others shimmy underneath. If you feel a cold spray of water, you’re out ’til the next round.</span></p>
<p><b>Perform on a summer stage</b></p>
<p><span>Do you have a burgeoning actor or musician in your midst? Set up a summer stage where your young thespian or rock star can come up with one-acts, skits, or concerts. Don’t worry, you don’t have to pull out the wood planks and drill (unless you want to). Use a picnic blanket, flattened cardboard boxes, or interlocking foam tiles for the platform and sticks strung with Christmas lights to border the stage. Your kids can create their own backdrops using a large dry-erase board or by coloring on cardboard boxes.</span></p>
<p><b>Build a box fort </b></p>
<p><span>We all remember the magic of playing in a fort. How markers, tape, and a sprinkle of imagination can turn a fine box into a fantastical wonderland filled with superheroes and villains. </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beautiful-minds/201203/the-need-pretend-play-in-child-development" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beautiful-minds/201203/the-need-pretend-play-in-child-development', 'Playing make-believe');" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Playing make-believe</span></a><span> is important for child development, and your kid will love exploring worlds in their new fort. Save all your boxes, and one day, when they’re bored as all get-out, have your kids take them outside and start taping them together. Help them make doorways and windows with a knife or scissors, then let them go wild with decorations. Solar-powered fairy lights, markers, crayons, paint — the possibilities are endless.</span></p>
<p><b>Play in the sandbox</b></p>
<p><span>Kids love sandboxes, and it’s an activity that will keep them outdoors — and occupied — for hours. One trip to the hardware store is all it takes for an easy DIY sandbox. Fill up a kiddie pool — the sturdy plastic kind — with sand. How many bags you’ll need depends on the size of your sandbox, but make sure you get dust-free or non-silica sand, as they’re the safest types for your little one to play in.</span></p>
<p><b>Make art on an outdoor chalkboard</b></p>
<p><span>If your kid loves playing with chalk but having a chalkboard wall indoors creates too much mess, consider building an outdoor chalkboard. All you need is a piece of plywood, some sandpaper, and a can of chalkboard paint to make a chalk wall where your child can draw to their heart’s content. Secure your chalk wall to a fence, the back of the garage, or lay it flat on the ground.</span></p>
<p><b>Climbing Wall</b></p>
<p><span>Kids love to climb and explore, so why not give them a place they can do it without ruining the furniture? An outdoor climbing wall is exactly what you need. Build a climbing wall by installing climbing handles on your fence, a blank wall, or a sturdy tree trunk then let your kids have at it.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<div class="hentry-content-captionless-image-wrapper">
<div class="hentry-content-captionless-image-wrapper"><img class="alignnone wp-image-50637" src="https://porch.com/advice/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lee-vue-tE4tioiVJNo-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="699" height="466"></div>
</div>
<h3><strong>DIY outdoor activities for adults (that the kids will want to join)</strong></h3>
<p><span>Summertime means less time spent indoors and more time spent outside. If you’re in need of some outdoor inspiration, look no further. Level up your backyard game with these creative DIY activities for grown-ups only — as long as you get a babysitter, otherwise, the kids will want in on the fun.</span></p>
<p><b>Sidle up to the tiki bar</b></p>
<p><span>Get out the cocktail umbrellas, make a pitcher of margaritas, and call your friends because things are about to get tropical. Want to build your own tiki bar? Bring a slice of paradise to your backyard using an </span><a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/outdoor-projects/how-to/a5871/free-tiki-bar-plans/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/outdoor-projects/how-to/a5871/free-tiki-bar-plans/', 'online tutorial');" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>online tutorial</span></a><span>. If you’re looking to keep it simple, snag a few tiki torches and colorful string lights to deck out your patio, tiki-style. Plastic palm trees and Hawaiian shirts are optional but recommended.</span></p>
<p><b>Have a fire pit</b></p>
<p><span>Drinking beer with the neighbors or roasting marshmallows and telling ghost stories just aren’t the same without a fire pit. You can buy a fire pit or build one yourself — there’s a world of options no matter which way you choose to go. The simplest way to DIY a fire pit is to dig a hole, lay down some quick-setting concrete, and surround it with a wall of cement blocks. Check your city’s ordinances to make sure they don’t have any special rules or regulations for fire pits then go forth and burn, baby, burn.</span></p>
<p><b>Soak in a hot tub</b></p>
<p><span>Is there anything better than a relaxing soak in your backyard hot tub? Hot tubs are the pinnacle of luxury and a delightful way to unwind after a long day. They come in tons of shapes and sizes so no matter what your backyard situation is, there’s a hot tub for you. The best part is that you can enjoy your hot tub all year round. Hang lights around your tub — or make night lamps (below) — to create a cozy seating area, and have a hot tub party.</span></p>
<p><b>Set out night lamps for ambiance </b></p>
<p><span>Make use of your up-cycled jar collection and line your patio or sidewalk with DIY night lamps when you entertain. Decorate the jars with paint or decoupage tissue paper, then fill them with LED tea lights or a string of fairy lights. These are fun and easy project that the whole family can participate in.</span></p>
<p><b>Swing in a hammock</b></p>
<p>Picture yourself lounging in a colorful hammock, <a href="https://porch.com/advice/perfect-reading-nook-tips-book-lovers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>reading a book</span></a>, and sipping lemonade in the sunshine. Feeling relaxed? Us, too. Adding a <a href="https://u5ztw95511wk1sqp-13239767.shopifypreview.com/collections" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hammock</a> (or two) will transform your backyard into an oasis and you’ll find yourself wondering how you ever spent a summer without one. </p>

<h3><strong>Outdoor activities for the whole family</strong></h3>
<p><span>Looking for a way to get the whole family involved? Make your backyard entertainment a family affair and create new memories that’ll last a lifetime with these fun outdoor activities. </span></p>
<p><b>Install an underground trampoline</b></p>
<p><span>Underground trampolines are more aesthetically pleasing than above-ground trampolines, and they’re easier for kids (and adults) to get onto and off of. Whether you choose to DIY your underground trampoline or have a company install it is up to you. Either way, trampolines are a fun and wonderful way to encourage your kids to get outside and get some exercise.</span></p>
<p><b>Set up a backyard movie theater</b></p>
<p><span>Lights, camera, action! Why pay to go to the movies when you can create a movie theater in your own backyard? Pull out the red carpet (or a picnic blanket, whatever you have on hand) and make some snacks for a summer screening experience the whole family will enjoy. Use your laptop to stream a <a href="https://www.projectorscreen.com/blog/Outdoor-Theater-101-Your-Guide-to-Unforgettable-Outdoor-Movie-Nights" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.projectorscreen.com/blog/Outdoor-Theater-101-Your-Guide-to-Unforgettable-Outdoor-Movie-Nights', 'movie outside');" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">movie outside</a>, or grab your projector and a large white sheet to create the ultimate outdoor movie night. </span></p>
<p><b>Go backyard camping </b></p>
<p><span>Get out the tent and sleeping bags for a backyard camping trip. Your kids will love this idea, and you may find that it becomes a regular <a href="https://www.happycamperlive.com/blog/post-detail/summer-activities-for-kids" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.happycamperlive.com/blog/post-detail/summer-activities-for-kids', 'summer activity');" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">summer activity</a>. Backyard camping gives you the best of both worlds – you get to make s’mores, tell spooky stories, and stargaze — all without having to dig a hole just to go to the bathroom. And if it rains in the middle of the night, a safe, dry haven is just feet away. </span></p>
<p><b>Dine al fresco</b></p>
<p><span>Having dinner on the patio a few nights a week is a simple way to enjoy the outdoors from the comfort of your backyard. Fire up the grill, and make all the summer favorites — ribs, corn on the cob, hot dogs charred to perfection — and savor them against a backdrop of sunsets and flowers in full bloom.</span></p>
<p><b>Picnic</b></p>
<p><span>There’s no better way to spend a beautiful day than by having a picnic. You don’t even need to leave your house to enjoy this outdoor activity. Prepare an array of tasty treats and take them outside for a backyard feast. Make an afternoon of it by bringing a board game and a few pillows to lounge on in the shade.</span></p>
<p><b>Forest bathe</b></p>
<p><span>Take a “bath” in the sounds of Mother Nature. </span><a href="https://time.com/5259602/japanese-forest-bathing/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://time.com/5259602/japanese-forest-bathing/', 'Forest bathing');" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Forest bathing</span></a><span> is a soothing Japanese practice to balance and recenter yourself. Venturing out into the forest isn’t necessary to take a forest bath — simply lay out a blanket in the yard, and allow your mind and body to be still as you take in the sounds of nature through your senses. If you live in a very urban area, you can still forest bathe — just focus on the sounds of birds and the wind, and feel your body relax in the fresh air, </span><a href="https://porch.com/advice/healthy-habits-at-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>relaxing your mind</span></a><span> and reinvigorating your spirit.</span></p>
<p><b>Swing!</b></p>
<p><span>Bring the playground to your backyard with a swing set. Swing sets come in all shapes, sizes, and price ranges so you’re sure to find something that suits your family’s needs. Swing sets aren’t just for kids, though. Create a romantic getaway on your patio with gorgeous macrame swings that’ll leave you feeling like you’re on a tropical retreat, or sit a spell on a porch swing, just like an old-timey date.</span></p>
<p><b>Create and watch a wildlife feeder<br></b><b><br></b><span>Butterflies, bees, and birds, oh my! Become a modern-day Snow White by setting up </span><a href="https://porch.com/advice/backyard-wildlife-sanctuary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>wildlife</span></a><span> feeders in your backyard. Birdbaths, hummingbird feeders, butterfly puddling stations, bee gardens – research the animals </span><a href="https://mol.org/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://mol.org/', 'native to your area');" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>native to your area</span></a><span> and decide which ones you’d like to attract. Building feeders is an easy project that your kids will love, too.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Banish boredom forever and create a backyard paradise in one fell swoop. Make the most of warmer weather with these <a href="https://littlesproutslearning.co/garden-games-for-kids/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://littlesproutslearning.co/garden-games-for-kids/', 'fun outdoor activities');">fun outdoor activities</a> to do from home — you’ll be enjoying the outdoors until your shoulders are sun-kissed and your heart is full.   </span></p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Are you ready to go big? FSO’s signature hammock, the Basecamp, is the largest hammock on the market! It was created specially to bring us together with loved ones and slow life down a notch.</p>
<p>The daily grind and the stresses that 2020 has brought us so far is enough to make us neglect our playful side; and playfulness is a vital component to a long and happy life! There are many ways for adults to get in touch with their playful inner child, so find something that suits your personality – it could be playing a sport, making art, laughing hard with friends, or dancing alone in your living room. Basecamp is one more way to add playfulness and joy to your life, and it’s made to be shared with others, both adults and children alike.</p>
<p>Basecamp is easy to pack with you on a day trip or to an event. Incredibly durable and adjustable straps make it hangable in any place, as long as it’s high off the ground so it won’t scrape the fabric when people are in it. Please check out our useful video for pro hanging tips! Like all of our hammocks, the super lightweight material packs into a small carry bag with a handle. It can hold up to 3 people, or 600 pounds, and packs up in about one minute flat.</p>
<p>Why get a Basecamp instead of a normal hammock? Because Basecamp is a showstopper! It’s a fantastic way to add fun to the party and will bring smiles and laughs to any event. It is a one-of-a-kind product that only FSO offers, and there are not many on the market. Let’s not forget that it provides you with some impressive photo opportunities! If you want to bring a unique experience to your event, or simply relax on a Sunday and with a couple pals, it’s the ideal toy.  </p>
<p>What is it good for?</p>
<p>Barbecues</p>
<p>Birthdays</p>
<p>Family gatherings</p>
<p>Kids parties</p>
<p>Wedding reception</p>
<p>Camping trip</p>
<p>Fundraisers and charity events</p>
<p>Potlucks</p>

    <title>How to Care for Your Hammock</title>

      <![CDATA[<p> </p>
<p>Enjoying the great outdoors means some natural wear and tear will happen to our gear, and as part of the fun, it gets dirty too! We want to make sure you get the most out of your hammock – and caring for it is easy. Follow these tips to extend your hammy’s lifespan and even help you grow more attached to your favorite piece of gear.</p>
<p>If your hammock gets dirty, salty, stained, someone spilled a beer, dumped a plate of spaghetti….you get it; you can wash it!</p>
<p>There are 2 ways.</p>
<p>-The first is in the washing machine – yes it’s washing machine safe! Take off the carabiners so they won’t clunk around, use a small amount of mild detergent (optional) and wash on a gentle cycle. Always air dry, they are NOT dryer safe.</p>
<p>-The second way to wash is to hose it down. Lay it open across a “soft” surface, such as grass, free from anything that may puncture or scratch it on the ground. Hose that baby down and even use a scrub brush for stains. Hang it up to air dry, out of the sun. Which leads me to my next point…</p>
<p>Keep it out of the sun. This is a big one, because we know it is <em>so</em> tempting to leave your hammock in your favorite spot, especially if you often use it at home. It can tolerate some sun of course, but it should never be left out in sunlight for extended periods of time – depending on the intensity of the sun in your area. For example, in Thailand best to not leave it up for more than a week or so in this sun. Your hammock should be kept in the shade. Sun will fade the color and compromise the integrity of the material, weakening the fibers, and it will become very prone to rips and tears. The sun is strong and will deteriorate any material it comes in contact with, so treat your hammock like your skin, and keep it in the shade to get the longest life out of it.</p>
<p>Hang it correctly! It’s tempting to get funky and creative with hanging, and we do encourage creative hang time. But don’t put too much strain on your hammock – meaning don’t string it up on points that are too far away from each other. This can put a lot of tension on the fabric, and with the added weight of bodies, it will certainly stretch and weaken the material over time. Refer to our <a href="https://www.flyingsquirreloutfitters.com/pages/how-to-hang-under-top-menu">“How to Hang”</a> video for a guideline. Hook the carabiners into the loops provided on the straps for the most stable, secure hang. This will help the straps last longer too, distributing the weight evenly.</p>
<p>Sometimes, fabric can rip. While our <a href="https://www.flyingsquirreloutfitters.com/collections/basecamp-1">largest hammock</a> can carry up to 600 pounds of weight, the risks of having a lightweight and packable material is that it can tear when punctured. While it IS repairable, we’ve made it easy for you to keep it off the ground to begin with. To avoid snags in nature, clip the hammock to a strap <em>before</em> you take it out of the sack – then whip it out and clip it to the other end in one swift motion. This signature hammock pouch keeps it off the ground at all times, giving you a clean and fast hang, and a really impressive move for your friends. Packing it up is just as easy – leave it clipped to one strap while you stuff it in the sack, then unclip from your strap once it’s all packed in. Make sure you don’t hang it too low; scratching it on the ground when you sit is a sure way to rip your hammock. Always beware of branches or thorns around you. If a rip <em>does</em> happen, you can sew a patch in the fabric by hand or machine, but you must be extra careful with it from then on since the overall resilience has been compromised.</p>
<p>Happy Hanging, All!</p>

<p>Savvy business students at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business MBA Program are getting a chance to hone their business consulting skills through the Global Business and Social Enterprise program, known as GLOBASE.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>The rapidly growing business consulting industry is expected to reach over $500 billion in profit this year. Savvy business students at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business MBA Program are getting a chance to hone their business consulting skills through the<span> </span><a href="https://kelley.iu.edu/programs/full-time-mba/academics/global-experiences/globase/index.cshtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external">Global Business and Social Enterprise program</a>, known as GLOBASE.</p>
<p>The goal: to gain international leadership experience doing a project that has the potential to change people's lives.</p>
<p>GLOBASE was founded in 2009 and has served more than 50 small- to medium-sized business and nonprofit clients in Latin America, Africa and Asia. Working directly with entrepreneurs and nonprofits in emerging economies around the world, the teams give them tools to tackle their unique business challenges.</p>
<p>Over 1,000<span> </span><a href="https://kelley.iu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external">Kelley School of Business</a><span> </span>students have participated since the program's inception. GLOBASE is structured as a seven-week course followed by a six- to nine-day excursion around the country and to businesses. The heart of all GLOBASE courses is an international consulting experience.</p>
<p>Twenty-five first-year MBAs work in teams to consult with business clients in five locations around the globe. Four second-year MBA students lead the project, with one faculty member and one staff member who provide guidance to the MBA student leaders.</p>
<p>GLOBASE has been working in the ASEAN region through projects in Vietnam, and this year marked the first project in Thailand.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>"GLOBASE projects are carefully selected to create positive social impact," said Rachel Fleishman, assistant director of global programs for the Kelley School of Business MBA Office. "Our teams work with nonprofit organizations and support 'pillar of the community' businesses. They give their clients tools to clear barriers to growth, identify expansion opportunities, find markets for their products, hire the best talent and plan for the future."</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to solve real-world business challenges that affect real people -- farmers, factory workers -- all while learning as future business leaders to explore and grow their talents.</p>
<h2>ASEAN successes</h2>
<p>Drawing upon the success of<span> </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/178272015" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external">GLOBASE Vietnam</a><span> </span>the program decided to expand further into the ASEAN region in Thailand.</p>
<p>Thailand and Indiana University recently celebrated 70 years of partnership, IU's longest-standing international partnership. The country is home to more than 1,100 IU alumni, many of whom are involved in business ventures abroad, making this a great partnership for IU students.</p>
<p>In Thailand, the students are working with<span> </span><a href="https://www.flyingsquirreloutfitters.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external">Flying Squirrel Outfitters</a>, a company run by IU alumnus Brian Carraway, who graduated from what is now the<span> </span><a href="https://spea.indiana.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="external">IU Paul H. O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs</a><span> </span>in 2007. Carraway operates a small social enterprise in northern Thailand, working with rural communities manufacturing hammocks.</p>

<p>He came to the country after graduating from IU during a rough economic time where more job opportunities existed in the Southeast Asia region. He immediately fell in love with the country and didn't want to leave so he moved full time to Thailand.</p>
<p>"I'm an entrepreneur at heart and wanted my own business, but to have a company with a positive purpose is my calling," Carraway said. "I had friends working with NGOs, nonprofits and social enterprises, and knew I wanted to do more meaningful work as well, not just hustle for money. I learned from others about social enterprise business and how running a 'for-profit' company that does some good in the world could exist."</p>
<p>Carraway met his future business partner, who was trying to bring more work to local women in northern Thailand through a hammock weaving operation. The two immediately hit it off and began working together on developing new products. They ultimately created Flying Squirrel Outfitters, which provides sustainable economic opportunities to women in the area. The business has been in operation for three and a half years and is continuing to grow.</p>
<p>"This has been the most challenging and rewarding endeavor of my life," Carraway said.</p>
<h2>A game changer</h2>
<p>Flying Squirrel Outfitters started out selling travel hammocks to tourists in Thailand. Now the company manufactures reusable shopping bags and totes, providing an alternative to single-use plastic bags. The products are made from upcycled plastic bottles recovered from Thai beaches.</p>
<p>The Kelley GLOBASE team came to help Carraway and Flying Squirrel Outfitters better understand and focus their marketing efforts and strengthen accounting practices.</p>

<p>"I can't say it enough, but it was such an honor to work with the students and faculty through the GLOBASE program," Carraway said. "The experience with my team far exceeded expectations. I even got a little choked up during the final presentation because of how professional and serious they took our business and offered extremely helpful deliverables and insights. I had never had anyone look so closely at the business and felt they genuinely were working to help me with real problems. This is simply game-changing for us."</p>
<p>It was also game-changing for the GLOBASE students taking part in the work. Meg Del Col is a first-year MBA student planning to major in marketing and hoping to create social impact.</p>
<p>"I heard about GLOBASE when I was applying to IU and knew I would love to participate," Del Col said. "What really drew me to the program was being able to help these people in a completely different culture from me while also learning more about that culture."</p>
<p>In Thailand, Del Col and her team wanted to give Carraway something valuable to help him develop his business further. Del Col saw firsthand the impact of the business on the local community, including the seamstresses who work with Flying Squirrel Outfitters.</p>
<p>The end result provided by Del Col and the GLOBASE team was a marketing program and financial spreadsheet to keep Flying Squirrel Outfitters' finances all in one place.</p>
<p>"The experience of working with Brian was something I will never forget," Del Col said. "It was amazing going to Thailand and being in a completely different culture. The Thai people are so wonderful and accommodating, and it was great to learn more from them and hear their stories. By learning about different cultures and where people come from, I gained a greater understanding of how I should interact with them."</p>
<p>And that is the reason Fleishman says the GLOBASE program exists.</p>
<p>"GLOBASE is important to Indiana University's mission of educating global leaders in business," Fleishman said. "We are challenging our students while allowing them to apply their knowledge and solve problems in a global context. And that has real, long-lasting impact for future generations of students."</p>

    <title>Island Hopping in Thailand&apos;s Adaman Sea</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><b>Krabi Province</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krabi is a fantastic option for seeing a lot of what Thai beach life has to offer. You will come to know dramatic cliffs, limestone and karst rock formations that will dizzy your mind, clear sandy beaches, cute little towns and plenty of things to do in all of these places - diving, rock climbing, kayaking, fishing and off-the-grid exploring in your <a href="https://v3nsejr53d3vh8zt-13239767.shopifypreview.com/collections/hammock" title="Hammock Collection, FSO hammocks, Flying Squirrel Hammocks">hammock</a>.  Keep in mind that not all of the coastline is sandy beach, so choose your destinations with your desired activities in mind. Let's get started!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1323/9767/files/phi-phi-islands-from-phi-phi-don-long-tail-boat-pptt-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1566557322" alt="hammock camping ,travel hammock, double hammock, 2 person hammock"></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Tonsai &amp; Railay Beach</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to the climbing haven of Thailand! This place is a palace of stunning rock, waiting to be crimped and shouted upon as it challenges your every move and makes you pour sweat in the stagnant Thai heat. But oh, the views are unparalleled. This is where climbers flock from all over the world, but you don't even have to be a climber to appreciate it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tonsai is a tucked away pocket of bungalows that are set back a short walk from the beach - apparently because someone has bought up the beachfront land, and it's just now starting to be developed. Tonsai is still fairly quiet and full of monkeys banging on bungalow roofs. Most bungalows are basic and comfortable enough for your average rock climber. You can find good coffee, great food, plenty of beer (and other comforts if you ask), and the occasional fire show. It's a nice place to go off the grid for a bit - there are no cars here - but there isn't much to do besides rock climb, so those are generally the people who come here. We've even been able to string up a double hammock from one of the main walls.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="hammock camping, hammocks, beach hammocks, double hammocks, hammock" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1323/9767/files/D943_163_458_1200_grande.jpg?v=1566557451" style="float: none;"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Railay, the beach next door, is a whole different world. 5 star resorts are packed in this little spit of land, and these days you can find a sushi restaurant, multiple gelato shops, massage parlors and even some tattoo shops along the walking streets of Railay. It is usually 5 times busier than Tonsai here, but the vibes are definitely different and it's a little more faaaancy. But this place is STUNNING. The rock formations are other-worldly and it feels like a pirate's wonderland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These two beaches are accessed by longtail boat from either Krabi Town or Ao Nang, and boats go regularly every day, no need to book ahead. It's only a scenic 10 minute ride away. Keep in mind there are no cars or motorbikes on either Tonsai or Railay; they are both small, very walkable places.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Koh Jam</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Koh Jam, also known as Koh Pu (ask the locals on that one...) is a small, quaint, lovely island to pay a visit to and completely kick your feet up. There's not much to do on Koh Jam, and that's wonderful. You can find both sandy and rocky beaches, little oceanside restaurants with the friendliest people who will invite you around for the evening, which will likely end no later than 10pm for everyone's bedtime. Driving around by motorbike is highly recommended. Stop by every little shop that looks interesting, and you will probably be the only customer and have a great conversation with someone waiting for a visitor there.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Koh Lanta</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Koh Lanta is a treasure. It's long been known as a sleepy island with long, empty beaches, but that's starting to change. Despite the fact that it's perfectly shaped like a gentleman's bits (or because of?) ...it's an incredibly popular island for families. Gentle beaches stretch for kilometers and occasionally have fun little waves to play on, but like most of the ocean in Thailand, beaches are as calm as a lake. When I last visited in December 2018, Lanta's popularity had skyrocketed and there was an abundance of construction going on for hotels, restaurants and even co-working spaces. Plan your visit soon!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lanta has 2 main roads running north to south on both the west and the east coast. Most of the beautiful beaches are on the west coast, facing the Andaman sea, so that's where the activity is. The coastline gets progressively more beautiful and less crowded the further south you go. The mountains rise up and give you some magical cliffside views before you get to the tip, Mu Ko National Park. It has beautiful trails, powdery beaches, a tall lookout point and some mighty fine snorkeling. Definitely worth the visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The east side of Lanta is made up of beautiful mangrove forests lining the coast, and Lanta's Old Town, the original village of the island. This place is CHARMING and you can't miss it. Old wooden buildings jut out over the water where you can eat comfortably, have coffee and enjoy the quiet side of the island. Talk to the locals, they are all incredibly friendly and not in a hurry. The tourist shops are very tempting to support, so grab something and encourage their craftsmanship. After you stroll around, keep driving south to the inner tip where you can see one of the remaining gypsy villages. There is even a really nice hammock shop on the island that sells nice locally woven hammocks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These sea people were given some land to make their permanent home, and it's interesting to stop through and see their boats, fishing gear, and lanes with cats, dogs and chickens. There's nothing to do in these villages and you'll probably feel like you're in their home or even invading their space a bit, so I wouldn't recommend hanging around too long. Just have a look and say hello. :)</span></p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Phi Phi Islands</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to the party! Phi Phi is full of backpackers, bikinis and beer pong, and it's on most young traveler's itineraries. It's stunningly beautiful and there is a lot to do. But for some people (like me, after my first time seeing it), it's a bit of a head-banger, and once is enough. Phi Phi has become very popular with visitors because the movie "The Beach" was filmed here. Not on the main island, but on the smaller island which is a national park, just a quick boat ride away. These two islands, (Phi Phi Don, main hub, and Phi Phi Ley, national park) are absolutely stunning. The isles have tall cliffs with vibrant colors and jungle creeping everywhere. The beaches are powdery, and these days, full of activity. Every day of the week is exciting and beautiful here, but you might be kept up late by pumping music from the bars if you choose to stay in the main center of town. "Town" also consists of only walking streets, and doesn't have any cars or motorbikes besides the ones to haul around local supplies. These little streets are quite charming to walk around if they're not too busy. There are some other resorts around the side of the island that look like beautiful and quieter places to stay.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1323/9767/files/liveaboard-thailand-phi-phi-island-xxl_1024x1024.jpg?v=1566557274" alt="hammocks, hammock island, hammock camping, hammock"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Koh Phi Phi Ley, the national park and site of Maya Bay, has been closed indefinitely as of 2018 because of the devastating effects visitors have had on the coral reefs and marine life. It was a smart move by the Thai government to start restoration efforts of this beautiful marine park, and since visitors have stopped coming there have since been blacktip reef shark sightings (yay!) and ongoing coral out-planting to re-grow the reefs. The state of Maya Bay was pretty dire before this closure - the bay was full of sunscreen, boat oil, trash and other chemicals that offset the natural balance of the marine environment, and the number of visitors to the bay each day was staggering. I am very, very pleased that Thailand has recognized this problem and has taken action to keep beaches beautiful and natural!</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Phuket</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When most people think of Thailand for a holiday, they think of Phuket. (Pronounced poo-KET). It's a big, jungled, mountainous island sticking out in the Andaman Sea, and it's gorgeous! But Phuket has suffered - and thrived - a lot from tourism. Thrived because it's a top beach destination in the world, and it has some of the best resorts money can buy. The scenery is stunning and there is EVERYTHING to do there. It has suffered because all these people create an awful lot of garbage - and land is still being purchased, bulldozed and reformed into concrete palaces for more people to come buy plastic water bottles and wash their sunscreen off in the ocean reefs. Yeah, it's a little maddening. Okay, let's back off. Phuket also has a lovely and busy local population and some fascinating traditions (check out the Vegetarian Festival - not what you'd expect!) making it interesting to visit, and there is a lot of land to explore. Phuket is a great destination, but it's a popular one!</span></p>

    <title>What&apos;s the best material for your reusable bag?</title>
    <author>
      <name>Brian Carraway</name>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s true that manufacturing and shipping reusable bags have an impact on the environment, any reusable bag is more environmentally friendly than the alternative:  single-use plastic bags. High-quality bags are generally better for the environment in more ways than one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how do you pick the best reusable bag for your needs? Read about your material options in this guide to help with your decision. You may also want to look at how to wash reusable bags as well. Sometimes, the best reusable grocery bags are those that you don’t have to spend extra time cleaning!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>COTTON</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bags come in many variations. Organic cotton is grown without pesticides and is typically certified using global standards. Recycled cotton consists of reclaimed organic and traditional cotton scrap (that would typically end up in a landfill), which is reclaimed or spun into new yarn. Traditional Cotton production involves a raw, natural fiber, but requires more chemicals than any other crop. Cotton is often regarded as the material which yields the best reusable grocery bags because of its many advantages:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advantages</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Biodegradable/Natural plant fiber</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Renewable resource</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Strong and durable</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Soft, smooth and pleasant to the touch</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Widely available in the USA and abroad</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Can be machine washed, with like colors, in cold water.  We recommend air drying to reduce shrinkage and to preserve the longevity of any printing.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disadvantages</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not moisture resistant unless chemically treated</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> High water consumption crop</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Traditional (non-organic) cotton accounts for 16% of the world’s pesticides</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Heavy, bulky and expensive to ship</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As with anything made from 100% cotton, bags can shrink and wrinkle with machine washing (to limit this, wash in cold water and air dry).</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><b>HEMP</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grows well without pesticides or fertilizers and is drought tolerant. Each acre yields three to six tons of dry fiber. Hemp fibers are one of Earth’s longest, strongest and most durable fibers and are several times stronger than cotton.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advantages</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Extremely strong, durable, and rot resistant</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Can grow in poor soils with little water</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Refined hemp is soft, smooth and pleasant to touch</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Most hemp reusable bags can be machine washed and dried</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hemp gets stronger over time and ‘breaks in’ nicely when used frequently</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hemp can be blended with other materials to make highly desirable, high end fabrics with texture similar to linen (hemp is typically blended with cotton or recycled PET)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disadvantages</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Currently cannot be produced in US (hemp products in the western world are imported)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Can be expensive</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Can be grainy, though most is refined.  Refined hemp uses a fair amount of water</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><b>JUTE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a natural plant fiber, often referred to as hessian or burlap.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advantages</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Natural renewable resource</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jute is biodegradable and compostable</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cultivated</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Durable</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Grows in high rainfall areas and require little to no pesticides or irrigation</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Can be blended with other fabrics (like nonwoven polypropylene)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disadvantages</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not very resistant to moisture unless chemically treated or laminated</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Grainy texture</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Printing limited to thick lines and bold objects (no fine details)</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><b>POLYPROPYLENE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a form of plastic—a flexible resin polymer. Nonwoven polypropylene bags are regarded as the best reusable grocery bags by some, due to their low cost and relative durability. The primary market measurement for nonwoven polypropylene bags is GSM (grams per square meter). GSM measures the weight and density of the material. The higher the GSM, the stronger the material. The fabric density is directly correlated to the quality and durability of the bag. GSM is indicated on almost all of our nonwoven polypropylene reusable bags. If it is not specified, please contact us for more information. Polypropylene can also be woven, though it’s not as common a material. We offer several woven polypropylene bags, though most are produced overseas at large quantities only.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advantages</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Recyclable #5</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Very strong</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Can be made from recycled materials</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chemical resistant</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> May be woven, making it less porous and easier to wipe clean</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wide variety of material color options</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disadvantages</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Type of plastic</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not biodegradable or compostable</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Product of the petrochemical industry</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Non-renewable resource</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not readily available in the USA</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not recommended for machine washing (hand wash or spray clean only)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Texture of the bag and thickness of inks used require fairly thick lines and larger font sizes</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><b>NYLON</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a type of synthetic polymer originally made to replace silk in fabrics.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advantages</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nylon is strong and durable</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lightweight material</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Compacts easily – can be folded, stuffed in a pouch, and carried in a pocket, pocketbook, backpack or car cup holder</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Easily dyed which creates interesting material color options</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Water-resistant</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disadvantages</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A petroleum-based product</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Slow to break down</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Heavy use can cause screenprinting inks to break down</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><b>POLYESTER</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a polymer typically made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the same material found in drink bottles. Polyester can be recycled through reheating, thereby converting back into polymer fibers for further reuse.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advantages</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Versatile material</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Polyester is resistant to water and mold-mildew</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Resistant to crinkling</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Compacts easily – can be folded, stuffed in a pouch, and carried in a pocket, pocketbook, backpack or car cup holder</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disadvantages</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A form of plastic</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Slow to break down</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Heavy use can cause screenprinting inks to break down</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><b>RECYCLED PET</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a durable, eco-friendly fabric made from post-consumer recycled plastic bottles and containers. Using recycled PET reduces waste and conserves oil and non-renewable resources.  Reusable bags made from recycled PET create a market for post-consumer recycled materials. Some of our best-selling reusable bags are the ones that are made from recycled materials!</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advantages</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Strong and durable</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Requires 2/3 less energy to manufacture products made out of PET</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Can be blended with other fabric, like hemp or polyester, to make a nice material for reusable bags</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disadvantages</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A form of plastic</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The process of transporting, sorting and recycling post-consumer waste expends energy and can create pollution (Remember: reduce, reuse, recycle — in that order)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not recommended for machine washing (handwash only)</span></li>

    <title>Cotton tote bags are NOT eco-friendly?</title>

<p class="heading | margin_centered bold">Since it's made of natural fibers, it might be intuitive to assume cotton is eco-friendly. But pretty much all assessments comparing bags agree that cotton totes have the worst impact. Cotton takes a lot of water to grow, fertilizing it leads to river and ocean pollution, and it is energy-intensive to convert the raw fibers to textile. For a particular organic tote, the Denmark assessment found that you'd have to reuse it 20,000 times to match the impact of a single plastic bag. </p>
<p class="heading | margin_centered bold">That really high number is based on an ozone-depleting chemical used in manufacture (which some have argued is an unrealistic representation of cotton manufacture). In terms of contributing to global warming, the same totes only needs to be reused 149 times. And, especially if you use if, for years, you'll still be cutting back on plastic pollution.</p>
<p class="heading | margin_centered bold"> If you are interested in buying a cotton tote bag and want to keep your environmental impact as low as possible... Choose organic and recycled cotton reusable bags, or calico, an unbleached cotton material that undergoes less processing.</p>

<p><span>Hemp and jute (also called hessian or burlap) need less pesticide and fertilizer than cotton, but still use a significant amount of water in cultivation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no denying it, single-use disposable plastic bags are suffocating the planet! The need for change is upon us and it's all our responsibility to begin making small changes that will have a big impact. FSO created NoNo Bags to help join in the fight against single-use plastic bags.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The  </span><a href="https://www.flyingsquirreloutfitters.com/collections/nono-bags"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NoNo Bags</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mission is to help YOU say “NoNo” to plastic bags once and for all. We empower you to take a more active role in combating single-use plastic bags by designing the most convenient, attractive, and durable handmade bags around.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1323/9767/files/replace_large.jpg?v=1566024417" alt="reusable bags, tote bags, sustainable bags, handmade bags, tote bag"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our bags are handmade with love in Thailand from upcycled materials leftover from making Flying Squirrel Outtifers hammocks - strong stuff. Each handmade reusable bag supports sustainable job creation and a fair living wage for “stay-at-home” seamstresses in rural Thailand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1323/9767/files/104A1200_large.jpg?v=1566024085" alt="handmade tote bags, reusable tote bags, sustainable tote bags, bags"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We partner with organizations, businesses, and schools who share our mission by selling and co-branding our bags to begin helping individuals to eliminate single-use plastic bags. We offer products that empower people to take an active role in solving the single-use problem. We make bagging the single-use habit easy!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent report by the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy found that Thailand is one of the world's top-five plastic polluters, a group that includes China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Together those countries are responsible for more than half of the 8 million metric tons of plastic trash that washes into the ocean annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But cleaning up plastic pollution in Thailand is a challenge due to cultural norms, infrastructure, and environmental obstacles, according to locals and expats working to address the issue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1323/9767/files/380-25_large.jpg?v=1566024305" alt="reusable bags, tote bags, no plastic bags, tote bag, sustainable bags"></span></p>

    <title>12 TIPS to Remember Your Reusable Bag</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have all forgotten our bags on occasion, and it does happen. Feel that guilt at the checkout when you realize you don't have yours and accept yet another plastic bag? ...yah, not a great feeling. Our <a href="https://www.flyingsquirreloutfitters.com/collections/nono-bags" title="Reusable Tote Bags, tote bags, reusable bags, NoNo Bags">NoNo Bags</a> were specifically designed to help you not forget yours, but here are some additional tips that may help even the most forgetful shoppers. We’ve even recently just learned the last tip listed – technology is amazing!</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always start your shopping list with ‘bags’ so you remember to bring them with you when you shop.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put your reusable bags back in your car or bag after you unpack your shopping so they are ready for next time. If you own two cars, keep bags in both cars. <a href="https://www.flyingsquirreloutfitters.com/collections/nono-bags" title="Reusable tote bags, tote bags, reusable bags, eco bags, sustainable bags">NoNo Bags</a> can even tie around your purse strap so it's always on you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hang them somewhere convenient, like your key hook or near your front door.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always keep one in your handbag for the quick duck into the supermarket.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try sewing or knitting your own reusable tote bags. Then you’ll be so eager to show them off that you won’t forget them!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you remember you’ve forgotten your reusable bags while your shopping, put your trolley aside and duck out to the car. After losing your place in line a few times you will start to remember those bags!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go Kroger style, pack everything back into your cart (bagless) and load into the bags when your back at the car. I’ve seen people do this!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forget the reusable bags altogether and keep/take a wicker or laundry basket in your car boot to transfer the groceries into from the shopping cart.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you pop in at a relative or friends place on the way home and have a small amount of shopping with you that needs to be kept in the fridge or freezer, put your keys in the fridge or freezer with the goods. Great if you stay longer than expected! </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have different colored bags for particular products, ie a green bag for produce, red bag for meat and another color for household items.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put a note on your dashboard, “don’t forget bags!”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOW, if you have an iPhone you have “reminders” which you can set to alert you when you “arrive” at a location. ie say “Hey Siri, remind me when I get to Krogers (and say your suburb) to remember my shopping bags”. Go into location settings in the reminder to check that it’s the correct location.</span></li>

<h3 name="c7cf" class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">The Conflict</strong></h3>
<p name="75a7" class="graf graf--p">The situation in Burma is as complex as it is long. Over 60 years of civil war have left Burma one of the poorest countries in the world. During this time, successive military dictatorships killed thousands of their own people and displaced millions in resistance areas. The resulting power vacuum has created a situation ripe for drug cultivation, child soldiers, acts of possible genocide, and starvation.</p>
<h3 name="cb31" class="graf graf--h3">Who are the Free Burma Rangers?</h3>
<p name="9b70" class="graf graf--p">The <a href="http://www.freeburmarangers.org/" data-href="http://www.freeburmarangers.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Free Burma Rangers</a> (FBR) is a multi-ethnic humanitarian service movement working to bring help, hope and love to people in the conflict zones of Burma, Iraq, and Sudan. Working in conjunction with local ethnic pro-democracy groups, FBR trains, supplies, and later coordinates with what become highly mobile multipurpose relief teams. After training these teams to provide critical emergency medical care, shelter, food, clothing and human rights documentation in their home regions.</p>
<figure name="6d89" class="graf graf--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*8oCWGOjXyGpb1-1F7YvJdQ.jpeg" data-width="650" data-height="300" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8oCWGOjXyGpb1-1F7YvJdQ.jpeg"></figure>
<p name="64b5" class="graf graf--p">In addition to relief and reporting, other results of the teams’ actions are the development of leadership capacity, civil society and the strengthening of inter-ethnic unity. The teams are to avoid contact with the Burma Army or other attacking forces and operate under the protection of the ethnic resistance armies. However, they cannot run away if the people they are helping cannot escape the attacks. Men and women of many ethnic groups and religions are part of FBR.</p>
<h3 name="48fe" class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Hammocks for the Rangers</strong></h3>
<figure name="ae29" class="graf graf--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ebmugXFBLx4FCHlolhcuZw.jpeg" data-width="2001" data-height="1500" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ebmugXFBLx4FCHlolhcuZw.jpeg"></figure>
<p name="9b99" class="graf graf--p">I met Paul Bradley, the Director of FBR, at a local event here in Thailand and quickly became fascinated with the nature of his humanitarian work with the Rangers. One point he emphasized was the rangers couldn't set up camp in most conflict areas because they needed to be mobile to avoid detection from the Burma Army. That meant they couldn't use tents on their expeditions.</p>
<p name="195e" class="graf graf--p">Paul seemed interested in our hammocks and how they were made, so we began talking about outfitting custom hammocks for the Rangers. We discussed a hybrid design that would best meet their needs in the field.</p>
<p name="6d7b" class="graf graf--p">The Rangers needed a lighter, more compact hammock with untied loose rope threaded through the end channels so they didn’t have to carry straps separately. The loose rope allows them to turn the hammock into a gurney or stretcher of sorts to evacuate the injured. The design adjusts to open with all four corners separated, allowing the Rangers to carry people to safety.</p>
<p name="b1c5" class="graf graf--p">After a few prototypes, we were able to secure the right design for the crew and outfitted the team with their own FBR retrofitted hammocks!</p>
<figure name="3d86" class="graf graf--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*1f6OAF__6OA6jlzaEaHXlg.jpeg" data-width="1136" data-height="852" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*1f6OAF__6OA6jlzaEaHXlg.jpeg"></figure>
<p name="68db" class="graf graf--p">The Rangers have recently used their hammocks on missions in Kurdistan, Iraq, Syria, and other war-stricken areas of the Middle East. We are honored to help support, if even just a little, their efforts to bring relief to victims of war and oppression around the globe.</p>

    <title>This History of Hammocks</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh praise be to the hammock! Who thought of this marvelous craft? Whoever it was has saved millions of people from sleeping on floors, relaxing on rocks, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">taking that nap....we know we all love the <a href="https://3onlne7xlhfo1bvt-13239767.shopifypreview.com/collections/hammock">hammock</a>. Let's learn a little about this brilliant invention.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hammock is known as the cradle of humankind. Its origins are in Central and South America. "Hamaka" is a word in Taino, spoken by the indigenous people of the Caribbean. It was first dreamt up by weaving together the bark of the Hamack tree. It's purpose was for sleeping, as it kept people off the ground and away from insects, stinging nocturnal creatures, and even prevented the spread of diseases by providing a clean, isolated place to rest. Hammocks have been dated back about 1,000 years, although it's highly likely they date back even further. Decomposition of the natural materials that were used are untraceable, so solid evidence of hammocks are based off the written and spoken word.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthropologists speculate that the Mayans were one of the first civilizations to use a hammock, along with other tribes in the area. They were used as beds, for traveling, children slept in them, and people were even buried with them. It's been found that hammocks were made from liana, agave, palm tree leaves, leather and animal hair, and later cotton. In 1570 it was recorded in Brazil that most of the beds were in fact hammocks, strung up inside the house.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christopher Columbus arrived to the Bahamas and saw how hammocks were used by the locals, decided he liked that idea and brought a few back to Europe with him, claiming he discovered them. Just kidding. But this is when the hammock was first introduced to Spain, and they quickly spread throughout Europe, because, what an amazing idea. Europeans began to make hammocks from cloth and canvas, giving them a more insulated, warmer bed as opposed to the thin fibrous nets used in the warmer Americas.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hammocks became especially popular with sailors and were used widely on ships during long voyages. They maximize space and alleviate sailors from having to sleep on the hard, wet floors. The swaying motion of the ship provided tremendous relief, allowing sailors to catch a longer sleep and get off the feces-ridden planks that festered with disease. What a breakthrough! Even better, hammocks were known to cure seasickness! A hammock swaying with the ship's motion helps equalize the rolling of the ship and can cancel out heavy motion sickness. And what do you know - it still does today, so try it out.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travelers saw how practical hammocks can be, and they became popular with soldiers and explorers. The English and Spanish navies both chose the hammock as their preferred bedding, and it was used for the next 3 centuries and all throughout WWI and II. Soldiers in Vietnam were provided with hammocks on their departure, since they are space-saving and lightweight, and again very sanitary.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hammocks reached the United States in the late 19th century. They were used by farmers and also caught on as a leisure item and were popular among upper-class families. Also in the 19th century, the British adopted the hammock into their prisons to save space and cut costs but soon realized that these hammocks ended up providing valuable materials to inmates who had some mighty good ideas for things to make.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hammocks have long been known for centuries to prevent the spread of disease. They isolate a person and keep them safe off the ground, and mosquito netting can easily be wrapped around them, providing a safe, well-ventilated place to recover. Hammocks were a vital part of a plan to eradicate an outbreak of Yellow Fever during the construction of the Panama Canal, and it helped immensely. Tribal communities have used hammocks for this reason for centuries and still rely on it today as a comfortable and confined recovery place.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days hammock are still heavily used across Latin America and Asia. They function well in tropical climates and they are easy to make in poorer regions of the world and certainly cheaper than a bed. Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, Colombia and Brazil all use hammocks commonly, and in Asia - Cambodia and Laos often use them for children's beds and as resting spots. Their practicality has been known for centuries, and it's introduction to the rest of the world has been a game-changer to relieve discomfort and disease. All hail the hammock! Go grab one today and kick up your feet, and be glad you're not sleeping on a sewage-ridden deck of a ship.</span></p>

    <title>A Packing List to Embrace Minimalist Travel</title>
    <author>
      <name>Brian Carraway</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to travel is light, but we still need to be self-sufficient and stay comfortable when adventuring around the globe. Minimalist travel is a mindset to use only what we really need, without creating excess waste or hauling around excessive items. In the wake of climate change and the staggering amount of waste and environmental destruction that our planet is enduring, it’s more important than ever to be mindful of our consumption. Traveling naturally causes us to think about how little we actually need to be happy and comfortable, and being aware of this will help us create a low carbon footprint and the least amount of impact wherever we go.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before your trip, start thinking about things you use every day out of necessity. Not a want, but a necessity. You can probably narrow that list down to a few things. We're here to give you some excellent ideas that will make your trip more comfortable, adventurous and practical without dragging around items that you might only use once.</span></p>
<br>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But first! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of my favorite products that I won't leave home without. Maybe they will become yours too...</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Universal Soap. Liquid form is the best. All those soaps and washes we might use at home? Cram those all into one practical, economical, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">safe</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, efficient soap. Find a small, sealed container to bring it in, and it will not let you down - for this soap will clean ANYTHING. Hair, skin, clothes, bags, cats, you name it. Dr. Bronners is an excellent example of a multi-purpose soap. Even more importantly - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">it's safe for the environment.</span></i></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cotton wrap or sarong. Guys, these are not just for ladies. Call it a man cloth if you must. It's an incredibly versatile piece of fabric serving endless purposes. It's a scarf; it's a body wrap. It's a sling if you need to bring something home from the market. It's a blanket when you're traveling and cold. It's a barrier between dirty dorm sheets. It covers your eyes when you want to nap. It's a beach throw. It's a shower towel. Need to carry a baby? It does that too. Should I go on?</span></p>
<br>
<p><a href="https://www.flyingsquirreloutfitters.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hammock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since I first bought a packable hammock over 8 years ago, I couldn't believe the possibilities, fun and comfort I suddenly had at my fingertips. A travel hammock can provide a comfortable place to rest - ANYTIME! If the environment is safe and suitable, it is a wondrous place to sleep for the night and will save you the cost of accommodation. If you are staying with a friend or in a home, a hammock keeps you out of the way and takes up minimal space. Camping with a hammock saves tent and pad space in your backpack and makes a huge difference in the weight you carry. It's also a lot of fun to use when hiking or on day trips, making sure you get off your feet and get the downtime you need to keep your energy high when cramming in the sights and lifestyle of traveling. Get a double for intimate moments.</span></p>
<br>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On to the list!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your packing will of course vary depending on what kind of traveling you do, but here are some bare minimum essentials that will keep you comfortable and happy while traveling as light as possible.</span></p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Plastic is everywhere! In the 1980's and 90's we were taught to use plastic instead of paper because it was a clean, cheap alternative to paper, and our goal was to save the rainforest. Now look what we've done. Our oceans are full of it and it's not breaking down. This crisis is not slowing until we make some major shifts in our lifestyle. Every little good decision helps, and 1 less bag does make a difference because it won't be THAT bag floating down the drain ditch next week. Here are some great ways to kick those everyday plastic products out of your life - these add up fast, and imagine the waste you can save in a year!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1323/9767/files/fso-plastic-vs-reusable.png?v=1560252340" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <span style="color: #666666;"><em><small>Image credits: www.planetexperts.com</small></em></span></p>
<p><strong>Plastic bottles -----&gt; Reusable bottles</strong><br> There is a plethora of reliable reusable bottles on the market now, so you have no excuse for not using one! If a big one is too big to carry, then go for a smaller one you can refill. Attach a carabiner if you want to strap it in or on a bag, and it will definitely help you drink more water throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>Paper coffee cups -----&gt; Take-away mugs</strong> (Do these even have a proper name?!)<br> While not technically plastic, paper cups still require plastic lids and linings and altogether are responsible for a LOT of waste. Switch to a take-away mug to hold more hot goodness than those cups ever could. Many of these mugs are completely spill-proof! You can throw them in your bag, and unlike paper cups, they keep beverages hot for so much longer. This is a win-win. Paper cups lose.</p>
<p><strong>Plastic straws -----&gt; Reusable straws</strong><br> The world has been crazy about omitting plastic straws lately, and although they're one of the smallest pieces of plastic that we use, they are not to be discounted because we use A LOT of them! I think we should just be big boys and girls and stop using straws altogether....but some bars and fancy pants places will have a hard time letting them go. So go bamboo or metal! There are many sprouting companies producing strong, sturdy and stylish straws that are easy to clean with hot water or a quick brush. Restaurants, bars and businesses are the ones who need to step it up in providing reusable straws to customers, but we understand customers can't always take them away. So get your own! Don't worry, it will catch on soon. They pair great with your reusable cup.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.flyingsquirreloutfitters.com/pages/nono-bags" title="NoNo Bags"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1323/9767/files/52797064_1188838367957141_8012743394608545792_o_large.jpg?v=1553359767" style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></a></p>
<p><strong>Plastic bags -----&gt; Reusable Bags...our <a href="https://www.flyingsquirreloutfitters.com/collections/nono-bags" title="Reusable Tote Bags">NoNo Bags</a>!</strong><br> Cloth bags are the future, and they are more stylish and packable than ever before. The main problem people have with using cloth bags is that we always forget them at home. We know, it's hard. This is why you need to make it habit to keep your little crush-able bag with you at all times. Make it a permanent part of your handbag or backpack. Clip it to your belt loop or on your keychain. There are so many great ways to use them and keep them on you, and these bags are so versatile. Who doesn't need a bag?! Grab yours and make it a solid habit. The number of plastic bags used around the world is ungodly and not even worth mentioning. Or should we mention it? Maybe you need some motivation....</p>
<ul>
<li>We use about one trillion plastic bags annually. That's nearly 2 million every minute.</li>
<li>A person uses a plastic bag for about 12 minutes before it's thrown out. That's it.<br> <em>(source: www.earthday.org)</em>
</li>
<li>NoNo Bags available soon...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Single-use plastic containers -----&gt; Reusable containers</strong><br> Hard plastic takes the longest to breakdown, and we use it in so many products every day. Food, bathroom products, office supplies, household items such as small shelves and laundry baskets.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1323/9767/files/fso-plastic-bottle-vs-reusable-bottle_large.png?v=1560237131" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><strong>Buy quality products.</strong> Don't buy something that is going to break in one month just because it's a little cheaper. Go for quality, and support the companies who make reliable products. This goes for pens, scissors, trash cans, mops and brooms, kitchen gadgets, etc. Buy something that will last a long time. Even better, don't buy the plastic version - wood, glass or ceramic is likely better quality and will last even longer.</p>
<p><strong>Buy in bulk and use your own containers.</strong> You can refill nearly all your kitchen products in bulk, and kitchens look much classier with all your own glass or ceramic containers! Spices, cooking ingredients, bulk grains, even sauces and condiments. You can also use your own containers for shampoo and soaps, cleaning agents, cosmetics, oils, pet foods and beverages. Make the change! You will have SO much less waste in your house as well.</p>

    <title>Could you sleep in a hammock every night? Some swear by it</title>
    <author>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p>We recently asked some of our customers and long-time hammock users about their experience sleeping full time in a hammock, and why they made the switch to full-time "hammock beds". That's right - full time! Would you try sleeping in a hammock? Their answers might surprise you.</p>
<p>The hammy sleepers we asked prefer <a href="https://www.flyingsquirreloutfitters.com/collections/hammock" title="FSO hammocks and straps">parachute nylon hammocks</a> rigged on a hammock stand in their bedrooms. Parachute hammocks are thin, flexible and breathable. Sleeping in other types of hammocks may also have positive results, but doesn’t always provide the same amount of side support or flexibility as the pressure point reducing, non-waffle printing parachute variety. Our respondents found that sleeping in a hammock every night has done wonders for their sound rest and improved their body and back pains significantly.</p>
<p>One of our responders is an ultramarathon runner and gave us some pretty convincing responses. He’s reported a massive improvement in his sleep cycle and overall feeling of wellness after making the switch to sleeping in a hammock nightly. He says, "It is the best thing for my back. I sleep pain-free and sleep much more soundly. On a bed, I switch positions probably 6-12 times per night. In the hammock, I don't move at all." It’s great news to hear that there IS a better way to boost the function of your body and mind by taking care of yourself even while you sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1323/9767/files/sleeping_in_hammock_large.jpg?v=1561094682" alt="hammock sleeping"></p>
<p>Think about the way a hammock cradles your entire back at a slight angle to eliminate the pressure points that plague many "bed sleepers". Most non-hammock sleepers envision laying in a big half-moon with your feet kicked up in the air and your back curved like a banana. Well, think again - while that may work for some people, sleeping slightly off-kilter or diagonally actually creates a flat surface area and allows you to recline completely, essentially creating a bed - brillant! You can adjust the position to create any amount of desired curvature by using the adjustable webbing straps.</p>
<p>Even the hypnotic swaying of a hammock has science to back it as the perfect method to help induce sleep. As reported in Current Biology, researchers write that "a rocking motion, long employed by parents to lull infants to sleep, synchronizes brainwaves, leading to deeper sleep with a quicker onset."</p>
<p>Sleeping in a hammock eliminates the firm, non-pliable, stiff surface that some mattresses give us. Fancy mattresses can run in the thousands of bucks too! Some mattresses are too soft and can hurt your back by overextending it if you're on your side or stomach. Mattresses that are too hard will leave you with aches and pains around specific contact points.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1323/9767/files/sleeping_in_a_hammock3_large.png?v=1561094876" alt="hammock with stand"></p>
<p>Sure, we still have gravity - but the contours of a hammock wrap you in and don't let your limbs fall flat like they would on a flat surface. The sides provide support for your legs if you want to rest them up, but aren't too firm to prevent you from moving limbs wherever they want to go. In fact, our surveyed sleepers reported that they barely move at all during the night anymore! Check it out their responses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to forego the bed and switch to a hammock?</strong><br> "Slept in a hammock for the two months’ time that I spent hiking over 700 miles of the Appalachian Trail. I returned to my parents’ house to heal after an injury forced me off trail. Sleeping in my childhood bed not only didn’t help me heal, but caused further physical pain and discomfort. Instead of paying exorbitant prices for something that would be difficult to move individually, I purchased a decent hammock stand (</p>
<p><strong>What is the #1 benefit you get from sleeping in a hammock?</strong><br> "Sound, pain-free sleep, waking up fully refreshed."<br> "Other than the cool/eccentric/different/mysterious factor, I get unparalleled physical relief and wake up feeling comfortable and revitalized."</p>
<p><strong>How does your quality of sleep compare to sleeping in a bed?</strong><br> <em>"It is infinitely better."</em><br> <em>"UNPARALLELED. I cannot express how far superior I find the quality of sleep in a hammock, over a bed."</em><br> So there you have it, a few testimonials from tried and true hammock sleeping aficionados who swear by this age old sleeping device.</p>
<p><strong>Do you suffer from back pain? Toss and turn throughout the night? Wish you could upgrade that mattress but find it too expensive?</strong><br> FSO wants to challenge YOU to try sleeping in a hammock. We want to see more people rested and waking up to their best selves! We would love to hear from those who give it a go and what results you find in making the switch. We also want to know what works or doesn't work for you. Are you up for it?</p>
<p>Try 3 days. A single night is not enough to change your sleeping routine, because humans are programmed to be comfortable in the beds we routinely sleep in, so give it a few days to adjust and see how your sleep changes, and if it does, we would love to hear what you find!</p>
<p>Happy resting, hangers!</p>

<div>Hi, I’m Brian. Four years ago I quit my comfy job in Seattle, sold my stuff, and headed abroad seeking something new. While traveling, I fell in love with Chiang Mai, Thailand and decided to sink some roots. I began working with local seamstresses, making travel hammocks for tourists. What started as an idea became an experiment and grew into a passion project called Flying Squirrel Outfitters.</div>

<span>We operate in small garment manufacturing villages in Northern Thailand, where seamstresses generally work in factories that recognize the minimum wage laws.
