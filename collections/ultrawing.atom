<p>The UltraWing was designed to trim the fat! We put this hammock to work, shredding ounces of extra weight to bring you our premiere ultra lightweight one person hammock. If you’re a weight conscious hammocker then our 11oz UltraWing design is specifically for you! Each UltraWing is meticulously handcrafted in the very homes of the creators, priding ourselves on superior quality using cottage construction techniques, and avoiding mass factory production.<br><br>The UltraWing features the same adjustable pouch functionality as its older brother, the DoubleWing. The adjustable pouch slides along the body of the hammock to create fabric tension, changing the size and shape of the hammock, giving you different ways to sway. Create a hanging chair to sit more upright in. Each hammock always comes with a set of tree friendly webbing straps - we won't sell you a hammock without a way to hang it!</p>
