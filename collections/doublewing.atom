<p>This hammock is where it all started. After nearly a year of sourcing raw materials, product development, and rigorous testing we gave life to our flagship product, The DoubleWing. Each DoubleWing is meticulously handcrafted in the very homes of the creators, priding ourselves on superior quality using cottage construction techniques, and avoiding mass factory production.<br><br>Designed for ultra-lightweight travel and versatility of use, we have brought you the first ever fully adjustable travel hammock. The adjustable pouch slides along the body of the hammock to create fabric tension, changing the size and shape of the hammock, giving you different ways to sway. Create a hanging chair to sit more upright, reducing the cocoon effect and increasing the visibility of the world around you. As a proper double sized hammock, The DoubleWing is designed to be shared with a friend or a loved one. Each hammock comes with a set of tree-friendly webbing straps - we won't sell you a hammock without a way to hang it!</p>

<p>This hammock is where it all started. After nearly a year of sourcing raw materials, product development, and rigorous testing we gave life to our flagship product, The DoubleWing. Each DoubleWing is meticulously handcrafted in the very homes of the creators, priding ourselves on superior quality using cottage construction techniques, and avoiding mass factory production.<br><br>Designed for ultra-lightweight travel and versatility of use, we have brought you the first ever fully adjustable travel hammock. The adjustable pouch slides along the body of the hammock to create fabric tension, changing the size and shape of the hammock, giving you different ways to sway. Create a hanging chair to sit more upright, reducing the cocoon effect and increasing the visibility of the world around you. As a proper double sized hammock, The DoubleWing is designed to be shared with a friend or a loved one. Each hammock comes with a set of tree-friendly webbing straps - we won't sell you a hammock without a way to hang it!</p>
